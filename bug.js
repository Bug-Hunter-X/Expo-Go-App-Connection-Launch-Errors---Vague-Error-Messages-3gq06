This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application. The error message might vary, but it usually indicates that the Expo Go app cannot connect to the development server or encounter some issue in the process of building and launching the application.  This can be due to network issues, incorrect configuration of your development environment, or problems with the Expo client itself. 

```javascript
//Example Code causing the error
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
