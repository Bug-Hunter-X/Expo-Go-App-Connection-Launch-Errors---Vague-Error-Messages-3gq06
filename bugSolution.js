Addressing this issue involves systematic troubleshooting:

1. **Network Connectivity:** Ensure your device and computer are connected to the same network and that your development server is accessible.  Try restarting your network devices.
2. **Development Server:** Confirm your Expo development server is running correctly using `expo start`. Check the console for any errors.
3. **Expo Go App:** Close and reopen the Expo Go app on your device. Try reinstalling the app.
4. **Project Setup:**  Double-check your Expo project's configuration and dependencies. Make sure everything is set up correctly.  Try creating a new project to rule out project-specific issues.
5. **Device and Emulator:** If using an emulator, ensure it is properly configured and running. If using a physical device, check if developer options are enabled and USB debugging is active.
6. **Firewall or Antivirus:** Temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus software to see if they are interfering.
